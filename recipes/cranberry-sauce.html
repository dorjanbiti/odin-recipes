    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces cranberries</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
        <li>White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
